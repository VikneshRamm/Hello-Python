1:Your skills of writing Paragraph will make you a perfect man.If you look at any printed prose book, you will see that each
2:chapter is divided up into sections, the first line of each being indented slightly to the right. These sections are called
3:Paragraph. Chapters, essays and other prose compositions are broken up into paragraphs, to make the reading of them easier.
4:For the beginning of a new paragraph marks a change of topic or a step in the development of an argument or of a story. In
5:writing essays or other compositions, it is important to know how to divide them properly into paragraphs. For an essay not
6:broken up, looks uninteresting and is not easy to read.The first and most important principle to be observed in constructing
7:a paragraph is that of UNITY.Just as each sentence deals with one thought, each paragraph must deal with one topic or idea – and
8:with no more than one. In writing an essay, for example, every head, and every sub-head, should have its own paragraph to itself.
9:And every sentence in the paragraph must be closely connected with the main topic of the paragraph. The paragraph and every part
10:of it must be the expression of one theme or topic. Note: A good practice is to read a chapter in a book, and give a short
11:heading or title to each paragraph, which will express in a word or brief phrase the subject of the paragraph.
