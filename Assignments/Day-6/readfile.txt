Your skills of writing Paragraph will make you a perfect man.If you look at any printed prose book, you will see that each 
chapter is divided up into sections, the first line of each being indented slightly to the right. These sections are called 
Paragraph. Chapters, essays and other prose compositions are broken up into paragraphs, to make the reading of them easier. 
For the beginning of a new paragraph marks a change of topic or a step in the development of an argument or of a story. In 
writing essays or other compositions, it is important to know how to divide them properly into paragraphs. For an essay not
broken up, looks uninteresting and is not easy to read.The first and most important principle to be observed in constructing 
a paragraph is that of UNITY.Just as each sentence deals with one thought, each paragraph must deal with one topic or idea – and
with no more than one. In writing an essay, for example, every head, and every sub-head, should have its own paragraph to itself.
And every sentence in the paragraph must be closely connected with the main topic of the paragraph. The paragraph and every part
of it must be the expression of one theme or topic. Note: A good practice is to read a chapter in a book, and give a short 
heading or title to each paragraph, which will express in a word or brief phrase the subject of the paragraph.
